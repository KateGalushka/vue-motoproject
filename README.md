# Motohub project
---

## Description
The project is made in Vue3 Options API with Firebase - Firestore Database, Storage and Authentication.

It serves as a guide for motorcycles models with detailed specification information and links to the AutoRia site.

You can search using filters on *Brand*, *Model*, *Engine displacement*, *Price* and *Types*.

Please pay attention to **pagination** - there are many pages!

Each motorcycle model, besides **Details**, has **Rating** and **Reviews**.

You can read **Reviews** for the selected model and browse through the latest reviews in **Last Reviews** section.

**Please, log in** to be able to:

* write and submit reviews, as well as edit and delete them (in Last Reviews section);
* add and remove models from the saved list of favorite motorcycles (corresponding buttons are visible to authenticated users).

### Features to develop:
* possibility of adding photos in users' reviews;
* table for comparing different models;
* up-to-date API for searching models absent in my data;
* extra pages for a blog, for adventure routes with maps etc.
